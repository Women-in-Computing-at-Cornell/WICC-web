      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>WICC was founded in March 2013 to bring together women in computing fields at Cornell, expand their opportunities and successes, provide a support network of women, and empower them to encourage younger women to consider computing fields. We hope to create a budding community for women and promote interaction on academic, social, and professional issues. By making women in computing fields visible, providing role models and dispelling stereotypes, WICC fosters a support network to empower women and encourage young girls to discover their love for computing.</p>
