Coincidentally, it was an interest meeting for the WICC mentorship. After meeting the mentors, we were struck by how vibrant and motivated everyone was; it felt like the beginning of something larger than ourselves. To put it simply, WICC inspired me to do more and provided me with the resources to do it.
