She received her S.M. and Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and her B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT, Bombay). She co-founded GrokStyle, and serves as Chief Scientist (2015-), and is a faculty Fellow with the Atkinson Center. \n Bala's work is inter-disciplinary, spanning the areas of computer graphics, computer vision, human perception, and architecture. Her research has had significant industrial impact, including the core rendering engine in Autodesk's 360 cloud renderer, and GrokStyle's visual search engine. Bala's 3D Mandala reconstruction was installed at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York, and demonstrated to the Dalai Lama." +

I was also a Research Scientist at the Microarchitecture Research Lab at Intel Labs in Santa Clara, California. In addition to being a member of WICC's Faculty Board I am also a 2016 participant of the Faculty Institute for Diversity. \nI support diversity in technology because I love computer science. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to participate fully in this stimulating field. Furthermore, a wider range of perspectives and backgrounds naturally yields more innovative ideas and wider applications. Increasing the diversity of computer scientists improves computer science.",

She did a series of postdocs and short term positions in computer science including time spent at Berkeley and MIT, and has been a faculty member at Cornell since 1989. \nShe has been the faculty advisor for the Women in Computing at Cornell since its inception, and though WICC's helped encourage many more women to choose CS major. She earned her PhD in 1984, the year that had most women in computing (see for example, the charts in this article for trends in percentage of women in computing). With the help of WICC, the percentage of women in CS at Cornell grew to currently over 25% from barely 10% not so many years ago. She is very proud of WICC for all the group has done to make CS a better major for women, and committed to continue this work, hoping to bring the percentage of women in CS at Cornell up to at least what it was nationally in the early eighties.",

She is currently at work on a book tracing the emergence of monitoring technologies in the United States long-haul trucking industries. \nI am committed to supporting diversity in CIS because we can't find solutions to the social or technical problems we work on without the benefit of multiple perspectives and lived experiences. Computing touches every part of life and every social institution, and it's key that we have diverse voices represented to ensure that new technology is developed and used in ways that address the entrenched histories of inequality and injustice in our society.I am committed to opening up space for all students to participate fully in CIS disciplines, and feel a strong personal commitment to ensuring that ours is a community in which each person's expertise and experiences are valued.",

    bio: "I became interested in computer science when I took my high school's Introduction to Computer Science course. I've loved math and logic ever since I can remember and computer science was a way I could apply those interests to solve real world problems. Coming to Cornell, I knew that I wanted to share my passion for computer science with other high school students who may not have had the same exposure to it that I've had. This led me to becoming a volunteer for the Girls Who Code program that WICC hosts for local middle and high school students. Now, as an Outreach Director, I help run this program which cultivates an inclusive and supportive environment for students to explore their interests in computer science!",

    bio: 'Before coming into college, I had no exposure to computer science. When I took my first programming course in freshman year, I remember being blown away by how powerfully versatile CS is and how it placed the power to make an impact, however big or small, right at my fingertips. But given my interests in medicine / healthcare, I struggled for a long time to reconcile these two amazing but seemingly very different worlds, until I found Information Science, a major that added that human element I always wanted in technology! As a student new to CIS as well as Cornell during the pandemic, WICC’s strong community of women helped me feel included and empowered—I felt like I belonged and had people I could connect with. Seeing how much WICC has helped me grow and how WICC was consistently behind many of the most impactful events of my new Cornell experience, I am so grateful for this opportunity to pay it forward and create that same impact on my fellow Cornellians and beyond!',
