    "title": "Co-President",
    "team": "Presidents",
    "bio": "I came to Cornell knowing that I wanted to study computer science, but I was a little hesitant about it. In my high school, only a handful of girls wanted to study engineering and hardly anybody wanted to study computer science. It was perceived as \"nerdy\" and simply entailed a lot of staring at a screen and monotonous coding, but I knew that computer science was more than that. To me, it's problem-solving, creativity, and innovating the future. I'm lucky enough to have an awesome mom that works in the tech industry and has been a role-model to me as I've grown up. Through her experiences, I've witnessed the hardships of being a woman in tech. As a member of WICC, I hope to break the stigma of computer science being some boring field and introduce people to its endless possibilities. I want to help create a more supportive environment for women and minorities in tech and motivate people to pursue their dreams no matter the obstacles.",

    "team": "Presidents",
    "bio": "For some, I'm considered a late bloomer as a Computer Science major. I'd always been obsessed with my laptop, playing around with Scratch or iMovie, but I didn't begin formally coding until my senior year of high school in my AP Computer Science class. In that classroom, I was already able to create the very programs that run on my laptop – I was hooked. In coming to Cornell, I participated in WICC's Lunch Bunch Program and heard from the inspiring women teaching here. I learned from them how they came out of university and the workplace not just unscathed, but also stronger. It is stories like these and my love for creating through coding that inspire me to turn my efforts towards aiding other underrepresented minorities in STEM fields who feel the same way. Through my directorship in WICC, I hope that I can not just bring our community closer together, but also extend a hand towards other allies to carry on WICC's mission.",

Computer Science has been my star subject since middle school, where I was first introduced to simple programs. Programming challenges me to think logically and rationally about a situation, and even if it gets challenging I do not lose my interest. This passion is becoming more and more intense with my recent exposure to Computing related studies and workshops at Cornell University, and I am very grateful for the experience. I would like to give back to my society and provide opportunities for others to better realize their dreams in STEM fields. As the Secretary of WICC Board, I have a wonderful chance to work in collaboration and reach out to the community. I am really excited to expose the dynamic and ever-evolving field of computing and technology to more women!",

    "bio": "In high school I stumbled upon someone's design portfolio one day and learned about human-computer interaction and design in tech. From then on I realized I wanted a career where I could tinker and create technology that would help people. However, a tiny part of me felt like I couldn't handle it, especially since the people I knew in tech were mostly men. Coming into Cornell I was intimidated by the difficulty of the CIS curriculum and felt like I didn't have a place in it simply because I struggled. WICC helped me in so many ways by connecting me to mentors in fields I was interested in to meeting other inspiring women who I'm honored to call my friends. Most of all WICC has made me feel like I belong in CIS. As part of board, I'm excited to continue leading WICC's mission to create more inclusive spaces in CIS.",

Coming to Cornell opened my eyes to the possibility of computer science as a career. I joined WICC because I was drawn to its mission to make computer science inclusive for everyone, and to foster a community of people who are passionate about computer science and who are always willing to go above and beyond to support their fellow students in any way possible. Now, as an Outreach Co-Director, I have been lucky to have the opportunity to further help WICC achieve its mission and to personally help extend the reach of computer science education!",
