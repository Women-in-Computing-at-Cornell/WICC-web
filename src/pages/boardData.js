      bio: "I am a Senior Lecturer in the Computer Science department. I obtained a BS in Symbolic Systems and an MS in Computer Science from Stanford University and a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I teach primarily undergraduate systems courses. Prior to my arrival at Cornell, I was a Principal Lecturer at Washington University in St. Louis. I was also a Research Scientist at the Microarchitecture Research Lab at Intel Labs in Santa Clara, California. In addition to being a member of WICC's Faculty Board I am also a 2016 participant of the Faculty Institute for Diversity. \nI support diversity in technology because I love computer science. Everyone should have an equal opportunity to participate fully in this stimulating field. Furthermore, a wider range of perspectives and backgrounds naturally yields more innovative ideas and wider applications. Increasing the diversity of computer scientists improves computer science.",

      bio: "Eva Tardos is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Computer Science and Information Science at Cornell. Her research focuses on Algorithm Design and the interface of Computing and Economics, with an emphasis on algorithms and games on networks. She is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and National Academy of Sciences. Tardos received her PhD in from Eötvös University, Budapest, Hungary. She did a series of postdocs and short term positions in computer science including time spent at Berkeley and MIT, and has been a faculty member at Cornell since 1989. \nShe has been the faculty advisor for the Women in Computing at Cornell since its inception, and though WICC's helped encourage many more women to choose CS major. She earned her PhD in 1984, the year that had most women in computing (see for example, the charts in this article for trends in percentage of women in computing). With the help of WICC, the percentage of women in CS at Cornell grew to currently over 25% from barely 10% not so many years ago. She is very proud of WICC for all the group has done to make CS a better major for women, and committed to continue this work, hoping to bring the percentage of women in CS at Cornell up to at least what it was nationally in the early eighties.",

      bio: "Karen Levy is an assistant professor in the Department of Information Science at Cornell University and associated faculty at Cornell Law School. She researches the social, legal, and ethical implications of new technologies, with particular focus on inequality, labor, and intimacy. She holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from Princeton University and a J.D. from Indiana University Maurer School of Law. She is currently at work on a book tracing the emergence of monitoring technologies in the United States long-haul trucking industries. \nI am committed to supporting diversity in CIS because we can't find solutions to the social or technical problems we work on without the benefit of multiple perspectives and lived experiences. Computing touches every part of life and every social institution, and it's key that we have diverse voices represented to ensure that new technology is developed and used in ways that address the entrenched histories of inequality and injustice in our society.I am committed to opening up space for all students to participate fully in CIS disciplines, and feel a strong personal commitment to ensuring that ours is a community in which each person's expertise and experiences are valued.",
