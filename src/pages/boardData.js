In my high school, only a handful of girls wanted to study engineering and hardly anybody wanted to study computer science. It was perceived as \"nerdy\" and simply entailed a lot of staring at a screen and monotonous coding, but I knew that computer science was more than that. To me, it's problem-solving, creativity, and innovating the future. I'm lucky enough to have an awesome mom that works in the tech industry and has been a role-model to me as I've grown up. Through her experiences, I've witnessed the hardships of being a woman in tech. As a member of WICC, I hope to break the stigma of computer science being some boring field and introduce people to its endless possibilities. I want to help create a more supportive environment for women and minorities in tech and motivate people to pursue their dreams no matter the obstacles.",

I'd always been obsessed with my laptop, playing around with Scratch or iMovie, but I didn't begin formally coding until my senior year of high school in my AP Computer Science class. In that classroom, I was already able to create the very programs that run on my laptop â€“ I was hooked. In coming to Cornell, I participated in WICC's Lunch Bunch Program and heard from the inspiring women teaching here. I learned from them how they came out of university and the workplace not just unscathed, but also stronger. It is stories like these and my love for creating through coding that inspire me to turn my efforts towards aiding other underrepresented minorities in STEM fields who feel the same way. Through my directorship in WICC, I hope that I can not just bring our community closer together, but also extend a hand towards other allies to carry on WICC's mission.",

After hearing about my interests, my Cornell advisor recommended trying out CIS, and although I initially assumed it was beyond my capabilities, I decided to muster up my courage and accept it as an opportunity to challenge myself- and I am so glad that I did. Iâ€™ve only started this exploration recently, and there have already been many times where I feel discouraged, especially when comparing my scarce amount of experience with my peers. But WICC has been my constant cheerleader, making me feel included and like I belong in this new environment. Everyone is so supportive, and it constantly motivates me to be my best self.

As a student new to CIS as well as Cornell during the pandemic, WICCâ€™s strong community of women helped me feel included and empoweredâ€”I felt like I belonged and had people I could connect with.

I am happy to say that I now fully do both of these things! Cornell has taught me the unique power CS has to provide usefulness and insight to any field in the world. WICC was a major part of reaching this understanding. WICC has led me to meet incredible people, and it constantly inspires and challenges me to do serve as better member of the CIS community.

Meeting and collaborating with such driven and supportive women not only pushed me to pursue my fascination in computer science, but also motivated me to build a space for girls to comfortably and openly experiment with technology. Coming to college, one of the biggest things that factored into my decision was a strong community of women in tech. Joining WICC not only gave me an empowering and encouraging community to be depend on, but was also where I met upperclassmen I could look up to and had a group of wonderfully talented and ambitious friends working to close the gender gap in STEM.",

Information Science allows me to ask these mindless questions and teaches me to work towards an answer. I like having the freedom to start little projects on my own, with questions like that in mind.
