My downtime is filled with reading comics, watching animated works, dancing to k-pop, and grabbing boba with friends. Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic challenged how I seek self-improvement. As an engineering student, I seek spaces where I can both succeed and fail but always have the chance to learn. â˜•Don't be Shy: Say Hi! I'm always open to a virtual coffee chat because I love meeting new people. In fact, thanks to a WICC boba chat with my mentor Femi, I discovered my love for product design. WICC isn't an org; it's my family. I cannot describe its impact on my life, and I know you'll feel the same way soon!",

I have taken every opportunity to learn more about CS since middle school and from those experiences, I have faced a wide array of problems from the male-dominated field. When I was looking at colleges I was really drawn to places that supported women in tech and I fell in love with Cornell for this reason. I remember looking up WICC before coming to Cornell and knew it was something I wanted to be a part of. After being a part of WICC Mentorship, Lunch Bunch, CTIC, Photo & Film Committee, and EBoard I can say with confidence that WICC has been one of the best decisions I've made in college and the best decision I have made to further my passion for CS and grow my confidence in my abilities and in a professional setting. I have met so many inspiring sweet women in WICC and I love helping connect other individuals to this amazing community.",

I remember being amazed at all the applications of computer science and after the program I was inspired to carry out the mission of Girls Who Code at my high school. During my senior year I was the vice president of IT Girls, a club dedicated to uplifting and encouraging girls to pursue an education in computing. When I was applying to Cornell, one of the main things that drew me in was WICC. I knew I wanted to be part of the organization before I even stepped foot on campus since WICC embodied the same values that I upheld during my time in high school.

As a student new to CIS as well as Cornell during the pandemic, WICCâ€™s strong community of women helped me feel included and empoweredâ€”I felt like I belonged and had people I could connect with.

Coming to college, one of the biggest things that factored into my decision was a strong community of women in tech.

Computer Science has been my star subject since middle school, where I was first introduced to simple programs. Programming challenges me to think logically and rationally about a situation, and even if it gets challenging I do not lose my interest. This passion is becoming more and more intense with my recent exposure to Computing related studies and workshops at Cornell University, and I am very grateful for the experience. I would like to give back to my society and provide opportunities for others to better realize their dreams in STEM fields. As the Secretary of WICC Board, I have a wonderful chance to work in collaboration and reach out to the community. I am really excited to expose the dynamic and ever-evolving field of computing and technology to more women!",

Like many other CS majors at Cornell, I was completely absorbed into the new world of programming through CS 1110 and I loved it. The creative freedom I had with the assignments and real-life applications to what I was learning convinced me that this was where I wanted to take my academic career. I have never looked back on this decision since, because it has led me to meet incredible people and get involved in amazing initiatives, namely through WICC. The WICC Girls Who Code program has helped me to connect with not only other like-minded volunteers, but also the passionate students of the Ithaca community. As a volunteer and now Outreach Co-Director, WICC has given me the opportunity to welcome young men and women into a more inclusive CS community and I couldn't be more thankful and proud.",

When I came to college, I felt trapped and creatively stunted in traditional engineering majors. After doing Lunch Bunch freshman spring and then taking Intro to DPD and being on WICCboard my sophomore fall (as well as soliciting lots of advice from upperclassmen), I decided to take the plunge and transfer to Arts to study Info Sci -- and I haven't looked back since! Info Sci is the perfect intersection between creativity, technical challenges, data science, and real-world impacts of tech. Now I'm passionate about technology for social impact and I hope to be a product designer one day. Here on campus I am the Business Lead of Cornell Design & Tech Initiative and the incoming Director of Diversity & Inclusion for Cornell Tri Delta sorority. In my free time, I journal, read, and learn new languages!",
