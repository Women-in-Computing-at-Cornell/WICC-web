When the pandemic hit in 2020, I wrote my first line of code. It wasn't fascinating to be honest. I wasn't amazed at the \"Hello World\" on my terminal but what I was amazed by the field of computer science and its applications. When I was still exploring majors, WICC allowed me to become part of a welcoming and determined community which allowed me to meet other passionate individuals while doing the semester at home. As a result, I hope that I can help others enjoy and create meaningful experiences and opportunities that WICC has to offer. ",

I was told I have a “man brain” for excelling in STEM subjects, but despite what my peers and teachers thought of me, I knew that the stereotypes about women in STEM were baseless. Due to the lack of opportunities, I realized how important it is to have programs and strong mentors in STEM for women and other underrepresented groups. Women must be encouraged in these cishet male-dominated fields, to ensure that different perspectives and ideas are shared across all disciplines. At Cornell, I wanted to be a part of something that creates a safe and inclusive space for women and queer people in tech, where everyone feels uplifted and capable, and surrounded by people who share identities, which is why I joined WICC. Being surrounded by some of the most inspiring women in the field, I have amazing mentorship opportunities offered by my peers at WICC. Eventually, I would like to become a mentor myself, and my mission at WICC is to further the intersectionality of tech spaces.",

However, I didn't fully realize that I truly wanted to study it in college until recently. I came to Cornell as a completely different major (PAM). After my first semester, I decided that I wanted to explore the possibility of majoring in Computer Science or InfoSci, which were majors that I always thought were so cool but didn't think I would be able to succeed in for some reason. During my second semester, I took CS 1110 + an INFO class and I knew that I wanted to become an InfoSci major. I knew because I was actually interested in learning the material from both courses and taking classes like those just felt right to me. After coming to this realization, I applied to internally transfer and also decided that I wanted to become a part of WICC so that I could be surrounded by women that have the same passion for computing. Prior to college, I didn't have much experience with computing so I'm super grateful that I was able to become a part of WICC. WICC really is for anyone and everyone, no matter what major you're in or how much experience you have--which is what I love about it.

    "bio": "In high school, I loved computer science because it reminded me of art: the power to create and impact. However, I struggled a lot to find my place in the tech community and felt extremely unprepared and lost in the sauce sometimes, especially considering the broad range of computer science. Coming into the WICC community made me realize that what I felt lost in, I should feel empowered in because of the opportunity to learn so much from both my classes and the admirable women in tech around me. I could finally envision myself growing within computer science. I am thankful to be a part of WICC and hope to not only continue learning from the people around me, but also to give my best back to others!",

    "bio": "In high school I stumbled upon someone's design portfolio one day and learned about human-computer interaction and design in tech. From then on I realized I wanted a career where I could tinker and create technology that would help people. However, a tiny part of me felt like I couldn't handle it, especially since the people I knew in tech were mostly men. Coming into Cornell I was intimidated by the difficulty of the CIS curriculum and felt like I didn't have a place in it simply because I struggled. WICC helped me in so many ways by connecting me to mentors in fields I was interested in to meeting other inspiring women who I'm honored to call my friends. Most of all WICC has made me feel like I belong in CIS. As part of board, I'm excited to continue leading WICC's mission to create more inclusive spaces in CIS.",

    "bio": "Having first-handedly experienced gender inequality, I know how challenging it can be to fight the stereotype of women pursuing STEM. I was skeptical about studying computer science until I went to and helped organize the Superposition Hackathon, an all-female and non-binary hackathon in Northern California. Meeting and collaborating with such driven and supportive women not only pushed me to pursue my fascination in computer science, but also motivated me to build a space for girls to comfortably and openly experiment with technology. Coming to college, one of the biggest things that factored into my decision was a strong community of women in tech. Joining WICC not only gave me an empowering and encouraging community to be depend on, but was also where I met upperclassmen I could look up to and had a group of wonderfully talented and ambitious friends working to close the gender gap in STEM.",

When I came to college, I felt trapped and creatively stunted in traditional engineering majors. After doing Lunch Bunch freshman spring and then taking Intro to DPD and being on WICCboard my sophomore fall (as well as soliciting lots of advice from upperclassmen), I decided to take the plunge and transfer to Arts to study Info Sci -- and I haven't looked back since! Info Sci is the perfect intersection between creativity, technical challenges, data science, and real-world impacts of tech. Now I'm passionate about technology for social impact and I hope to be a product designer one day. Here on campus I am the Business Lead of Cornell Design & Tech Initiative and the incoming Director of Diversity & Inclusion for Cornell Tri Delta sorority. In my free time, I journal, read, and learn new languages!",
