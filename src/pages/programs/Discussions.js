      <p>WICC is dedicated towards fostering an inclusive space for individuals of all identities to feel empowered to speak on issues in the CIS community, both on- and off-campus. We hold monthly discussions encompassing topics such as diversity in tech, the definition of success, and more. It is our goal to have a greater number of voices heard and to have a greater breadth of women and allies voicing their opinions at the table.</p>
